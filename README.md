## Conclusion
1. Delays in delivery occur more often than on-time delivery
2. Customer rating in categories 1 - 3 which has a high percentage indicates that the level of customer satisfaction is still low, therefore there is a need to improve service in terms of delivery and service provided to customers so that customer ratings increase
3. The highest mode of shipment on the ship route means the fleet must be increased or prioritized for the ship route
4. The customer care call value of 3 - 6 has a high total during the delivery process, therefore it is better to monitor the delivery when the customer care call has reached 3 times so that it arrives on time
5. Product_importance with a low category affects delivery so many experience delivery delays
